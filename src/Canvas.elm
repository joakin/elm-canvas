canvas.

See instructions in the main page of the package for installation, as it
requires the `elm-canvas` web component to work.

# Drawing shapes

Shapes can be rectangles, circles, and different types of lines. By composing
shapes, you can draw complex figures! There are many functions that produce
a `Shape`, which you can feed to `shapes` to get something on the screen.

@docs Shape

Here are the different functions that produce shapes that we can draw.

@docs rect, roundRect, circle, arc, path


## Paths

In order to make a complex path, we need to put together a list of `PathSegment`

-- HTML


{-| Create a Html element that you can use in your view.

    Canvas.toHtml ( width, height )
        [ style "display" "block", onClick CanvasClick ]
        [ shapes [ fill Color.white ] [ rect ( 0, 0 ) w h ]
        , text
            [ font { size = 48, family = "sans-serif" }, align Center ]
            ( 50, 50 )
            "Hello world"
        ]

`toHtml` is almost like creating other Html elements. We need to pass `(width,
height)` in pixels, a list of `Html.Attribute`, and finally _instead_ of a list
of html elements, we pass a `List Renderable`. A `Renderable` is a thing that
the canvas knows how to render. Read on for more information ðŸ‘‡.

**Note**: Remember to include the `elm-canvas` web component from npm in your page for
this to work!

**Note**: This element has `display: inline` by default, so their width or
height will have no effect. You can change it to `block` for example. See [MDN:
display](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/display) for possible
display values.

{-| Similar to `toHtml` but with more explicit options and the ability to load
textures.

        [ style "display" "block", onClick CanvasClick ]
        [ shapes [ fill Color.white ] [ rect ( 0, 0 ) w h ]
        , text
            [ font { size = 48, family = "sans-serif" }, align Center ]
            ( 50, 50 )

{-| A `Renderable` is a thing that the canvas knows how to render, similar to
`Html` elements.

We can make `Renderable`s to use with `Canvas.toHtml` with functions like
`shapes` and `text`.

-- Clear


{-| We use `clear` to remove the contents of a rectangle in the screen and make
them transparent.

    import Canvas exposing (..)

    Canvas.toHtml ( width, height )
        []
        [ clear ( 0, 0 ) width height
        , shapes [ fill Color.red ] [ rect ( 10, 10 ) 20 20 ]

    Renderable
        { commands = []
        , drawOp = NotSpecified
        , drawable = DrawableClear point w h
        }



-- Shapes drawables


{-| A `Shape` represents a shape or lines to be drawn. Giving them to `shapes`
we get a `Renderable` for the canvas.

    shapes []
        [ path ( 20, 10 )
            [ lineTo ( 10, 30 )
            , lineTo ( 30, 30 )

        , circle ( 100, 100 ) 80
        ]

-}
type alias Shape =
    C.Shape


{-| In order to draw a path, you need to give the function `path` a list of
`PathSegment`
-}
type alias PathSegment =
    C.PathSegment


{-| We use `shapes` to render different shapes like rectangles, circles, and
lines of different kinds that we can connect together.

You can draw many shapes with the same `Setting`s, which makes for very
efficient rendering.

    import Canvas exposing (..)
    import Color -- elm install avh4/elm-color

    Canvas.toHtml ( width, height )
        []
        [ shapes [ fill Color.white ] [ rect ( 0, 0 ) width height ] ]

You can read more about the different kinds of `Shape` in the **Drawing shapes**
section.

{-| Creates the shape of a rectangle. It needs the position of the top left
corner, the width, and the height.

    rect pos width height

-}
rect : Point -> Float -> Float -> Shape
rect pos width height =
    Rect pos width height


{-| Creates the shape of a rounded rectangle.

It takes the position of the top left corner, the width, the height and a list specifying
the radii of the circular arc to be used for the corners of the rectangle. The list must
contain between 1 and 4 positive numbers.

You can find more info on this [page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/roundRect).

-}
roundRect : Point -> Float -> Float -> List Float -> Shape
roundRect pos width height radii =
    RoundRect pos width height radii


{-| Creates a circle. It takes the position of the center of the circle, and the
radius of it.

    circle pos radius

-}
circle : Point -> Float -> Shape
circle pos radius =
    Circle pos radius


{-| Creates a complex path as a shape from a list of `PathSegment` instructions.

It is mandatory to pass in the starting point for the path, since the path
starts with an implicit `moveTo` the starting point to avoid undesirable
behavior and implicit state.

    path startingPoint segments

-}
path : Point -> List PathSegment -> Shape
path startingPoint segments =
    Path startingPoint segments


{-| Creates an arc, a partial circle. It takes:

  - The position of the center of the circle
  - The radius of the circle
  - The start angle (in radians) where the arc will start
      - 0 is center right, 90 is bottom center
  - The end angle (in radians) where the arc will end
  - If it should draw in clockwise or anti-clockwise direction

**Note**: If you want to give the angles in degrees, you can use the `degrees`
function from elm/core.

    arc ( 10, 10 ) 40 { startAngle = degrees 15, endAngle = degrees 85, clockwise = True }

**Note**: If you want to make a partial circle (like a pizza slice), combine
with `path` to make a triangle, and then the arc. See the pie chart example.

-}
arc : Point -> Float -> { startAngle : Float, endAngle : Float, clockwise : Bool } -> Shape
arc pos radius { startAngle, endAngle, clockwise } =
    Arc pos radius startAngle endAngle (not clockwise)


{-| Adds an arc to the path with the given control points and radius.

The arc drawn will be a part of a circle, never elliptical. Typical use could be
making a rounded corner.

One way to think about the arc drawn is to imagine two straight segments, from
the starting point (latest point in current path) to the first control point,
and then from the first control point to the second control point. These two
segments form a sharp corner with the first control point being in the corner.
Using `arcTo`, the corner will instead be an arc with the given radius.

The arc is tangential to both segments, which can sometimes produce surprising
results, e.g. if the radius given is larger than the distance between the
starting point and the first control point.

If the radius specified doesn't make the arc meet the starting point (latest
point in the current path), the starting point is connected to the arc with
a straight line segment.

    arcTo ( x1, y1 ) ( x2, y2 ) radius

You can see more examples and docs in [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/arcTo)

-}
arcTo : Point -> Point -> Float -> PathSegment
arcTo pos1 pos2 radius =
    ArcTo pos1 pos2 radius


{-| Adds a cubic BÃ©zier curve to the path. It requires three points. The first
two points are control points and the third one is the end point. The starting
point is the last point in the current path, which can be changed using `moveTo`
before creating the BÃ©zier curve. You can learn more about this curve in the
[MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/bezierCurveTo).

    bezierCurveTo controlPoint1 controlPoint2 point

    bezierCurveTo ( cp1x, cp1y ) ( cp2x, cp2y ) ( x, y )

  - `cp1x`
      - The x axis of the coordinate for the first control point.
  - `cp1y`
      - The y axis of the coordinate for the first control point.
  - `cp2x`
      - The x axis of the coordinate for the second control point.
  - `cp2y`
      - The y axis of the coordinate for the second control point.
  - `x`
      - The x axis of the coordinate for the end point.
  - `y`
      - The y axis of the coordinate for the end point.

-}
bezierCurveTo : Point -> Point -> Point -> PathSegment
bezierCurveTo controlPoint1 controlPoint2 point =
    BezierCurveTo controlPoint1 controlPoint2 point


{-| Connects the last point in the previous shape to the x, y coordinates with a
straight line.

    lineTo ( x, y )

If you want to make a line independently of where the previous shape ended, you
can use `moveTo` before using lineTo.

-}
lineTo : Point -> PathSegment
lineTo point =
    LineTo point


{-| `moveTo` doesn't necessarily produce any shape, but it moves the starting
point somewhere so that you can use this with other lines.

    moveTo point

-}
moveTo : Point -> PathSegment
moveTo point =
    MoveTo point


{-| Adds a quadratic BÃ©zier curve to the path. It requires two points. The
first point is a control point and the second one is the end point. The starting
point is the last point in the current path, which can be changed using `moveTo`
before creating the quadratic BÃ©zier curve. Learn more about quadratic bezier
curves in the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/quadraticCurveTo)

    quadraticCurveTo controlPoint point

    quadraticCurveTo ( cpx, cpy ) ( x, y )

  - `cpx`
      - The x axis of the coordinate for the control point.
  - `cpy`
      - The y axis of the coordinate for the control point.
  - `x`
      - The x axis of the coordinate for the end point.
  - `y`
      - The y axis of the coordinate for the end point.

-}
quadraticCurveTo : Point -> Point -> PathSegment
quadraticCurveTo controlPoint point =
    QuadraticCurveTo controlPoint point



-- Text drawables


{-| We use `text` to render text on the canvas. We need to pass the list of
settings to style it, the point with the coordinates where we want to render,
and the text to render.

Keep in mind that `align` and other settings can change where the text is
positioned with regards to the coordinates provided.

    Canvas.toHtml ( width, height )
        []
        [ text
            [ font { size = 48, family = "sans-serif" }, align Center ]
            ( 50, 50 )
            "Hello world"
        ]

You can learn more about drawing text and its settings in the **Drawing text**
section.

-}
text : List Setting -> Point -> String -> Renderable
text settings point str =
    addSettingsToRenderable settings
        (Renderable
            { commands = []
            , drawOp = NotSpecified
            , drawable = DrawableText { maxWidth = Nothing, point = point, text = str }
            }
        )



-- Textures


{-| Draw a texture into your canvas.

Textures can be loaded by using `toHtmlWith` and passing in a `Texture.Source`.
Once the texture is loaded, and you have an actual `Texture`, you can use it
with this method to draw it.

You can also make different types of textures from the same texture, in case you
have a big sprite sheet and want to create smaller textures that are
a _viewport_ into a bigger sheet.

See the `Canvas.Texture` module and the `sprite` function in it.

-}

texture settings p t =
    addSettingsToRenderable settings
        (Renderable

            , drawable = DrawableTexture p t
            }
        )



-- Groups


{-| Groups many renderables into one, and provides the opportunity to apply
settings for the whole group.

    Canvas.toHtml ( width, height )
        []
        [ group [ fill Color.red ]
            [ shapes [] [ rect ( 0, 0 ) w h ]
